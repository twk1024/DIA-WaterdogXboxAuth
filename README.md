# DIA-WaterdogXboxAuth
XUID Check for using Waterdog proxy securely

## What's the purpose of this plugin
To use Waterdog Proxy properly, you should disable xbox-auth of your server and this may cause security issues.
This plugin will replace that xbox-auth function and block players who are trying to join the server without log-outed status.
